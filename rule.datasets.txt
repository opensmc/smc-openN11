The rules about datasets

The basis premmis is that we want all the data to be public.

Requrements for default dataset should be minimal:
5 items max
"less is more"

All data should be accepted:
  Defualt dataset: hundreds of standard data fields
  Extended dataset: Addititional data availble


The required default data fields should be no more than nesscary to uniquiely identify the item.
