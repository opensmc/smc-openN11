Architecure of the open211 json data store

Linux friendly:
Source of truth is ascii text files
Git verson control tracks data changes

Dir Structure:
Based on the Object ID:
  us.ca.co.smc.parks_dept.parks
Each Object ID:
  Can have its own schemas
  Schemas are cumlitve, the child inherts defined data from its parent.

Individual data insances are stored in separate files based on their OrgUID:
  SMC-Parks-1.json,SMC-Parks-2.json,SMC-Parks-3.json,...
