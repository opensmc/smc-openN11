The open211 json data for the San Mateo County LAFCo organization

The format is json (java script notaion)
json is used by modern web based APIs (application programming interfaces).  It is very readable.  Ask if you don't understand something.

This entry is my "base level data" information.  The kind of information that if you were going someplace and it was missing in the app, you would goole for it.

In particular if an app queries:
  us:ca:co:smcgov:*
The app will  git this limited data about LAFCo.

On the otherhand if they query:
  us:ca:co:smcgov:lafco:*
The app will get a much richer set of LAFCo data.
  All the cities, boards and commissions.
  Information about LAFCo itself.
This is descussed in a separate document
